# DoorDashLite
DoorDash Lite App
Background
--------------------------
At DoorDash, we allow customers to order delivery from their favorite local restaurants. 
For this exercise, you will be building a ‘lite’ version of DoorDash.
Users will be able to pick a location on a Map, and view a list of nearby stores.

Requirements
--------------------------
1. Users can select a location by dragging on the map starting at the current location of the user.  
The address of the location of the pin should show in the text box above the 'Confirm Address' Button.
2. Users can browse a list of stores available to the location selected previously.
3. Tests
